    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h3>My name is Ryan Shaw, and I am taking CIS 445!</h3>
    <p>I have loved computers my whole life. Ever since we've had one in the house when I turned 4, I can remember constantly wanting to use it and poke around, play games, and learn how to use it. I think it's culminated in where I am in my career as a Techinical Support Specialist at Bradley University and finishing my degree in Comptuer Information Systems!</p>
<p>hi</p>
